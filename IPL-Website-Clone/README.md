## Project Description

This IPL website clone project was created for a competition. The goal was to replicate the original IPL website as closely as possible. Every element, from the layout to the color scheme, was meticulously designed to resemble the original site. We aimed to capture the essence of the IPL website, ensuring that the clone looks and feels like the real thing and this is what we came up with in a 3hr timed competition .
